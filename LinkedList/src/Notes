1.  while(curr.next!=null && temp.data>curr.next.data ) curr=curr.next;
All the corner cases should be written first in the conditions.
 -- curr.next!=null && temp.data>curr.next.data in place of this way, if the condition was written as  temp.data>curr.next.data
 curr.next!=null then you will get null pointer exception.
 Since we are accessing curr.next's data we need to first make sure that curr.next is not null  - Imp. point
 As, if the curr.next.data is fetched that implies curr.next is not null.
 Hence curr.next!=null is written before the other condition.

2. Using multiple ways to solve a problem i.e naive and then optimize. Be careful as the previous approach might have changed the
existing links, because of which optimized approach might now work even though the code is correct.
